"#Logical statements \n"
"\n"
"You've seen logical statements already, these are statements that can be "
"true or false, for example: \n"
"\n"
"```md\n"
"1. The sum of two odd numbers is an even number\n"
"2. $36$ is divisible by $3$\n"
"3. $x > 2$\n"
"```\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Lets see how one does this on a computer, specifically in lean. In lean, "
"logical staments live in a \n"
"world called `Prop`. So for example if we write `P : Prop` we mean \"$P$ is "
"a logical statement.\" \n"
"Think of the \"`:`\" symbol as saying $P$  lives in `Prop` world (in Maths "
"this would be denoted\n"
"by `P ∈ Prop`, to mean `P` is an element of `Prop`).\n"
"\n"
"#Truth Values\n"
"\n"
"The *truth value* of a logical statement (i.e. some `P : Prop`) is whether "
"the statement is true or \n"
"false.  For example, the truth value of the statement: \"For all integers $x "
"∈ ℤ$,  $0 ≤ x^2$\" \n"
"is *true*, while  \"For all integers $x ∈ ℤ$,  $0 ≤ x^3$\" is *false*. \n"
"\n"
"In lean we assign truth values as follows: We first think of a proposition $P"
"$ as a set with \n"
"*at most* one element.  If this set is empty, then we say `P` is *false*. "
"Otherwise, if this set has \n"
"an element, lets call it $p$, then this  statement is *true* and $p$ is the "
"proof. We will usually \n"
"use upper case letters for logical statements, and lower case for their "
"proofs.\n"
"\n"
"To recap, we write  `P : Prop` to mean $P$  is a proposition and we write "
"`p : P` to mean \"$p$ is a \n"
"proof of $P$\".\n"
"\n"
"The aim of this game is to learn how to prove logical statements, which we "
"call *lemmas* through a\n"
"series of manipulations which we call *tactics*. \n"
" \n"
"Lets start with a simple example of how a lemma looks like in lean.\n"
"\n"
"This is where the window on the right will come into play. If you delete the "
"*sorry* below, \n"
"on the right you will  see the following: \n"
"\n"
"```\n"
"P : Prop,\n"
"p : P,\n"
"⊢ P\n"
"```\n"
"\n"
"Here, the first two lines are our assumptions, where the first line `P : "
"Prop` says \"$P$ is a \n"
"logical statement\" and the second line `p : P` says $p$ is the proof of $P"
"$.\n"
"\n"
"The thing after the `⊢` symbol is what we need to prove to win the level (i."
"e. prove the lemma).\n"
"\n"
"In this game our \"moves\" or, as we call them in lean, *tactics*, are what "
"will allow us to \n"
"manipulate our statements and produce proofs.\n"
"\n"
"The first tactic we will use is called *exact*. It is used when you need to "
"prove a \n"
"statement $P$ and you have the proof of it. In the example above we have `p: "
"P` and we need to\n"
"prove `P`, then `exact p,` will prove it. \n"
"\n"
"**Note:  We end each line with a comma `,` to tell lean that this is the end "
"of our move.** \n"
"\n"
"Try it for yourself now and see what happens!\n"

"#Combining logical statements\n"
"\n"
"We can combine basic statements to create new ones. For example, we can "
"write `¬P` for the \n"
"statement \"Not $P$\" and if we have two statements `P Q : Prop` we can "
"write ` P → Q` to mean \n"
"$P$ implies $Q$. \n"
"\n"
"Say we have the following lemma:\n"
"\n"
"```\n"
"P Q : Prop\n"
"h : P → Q\n"
"p : P\n"
"⊢ Q\n"
"```\n"
"As in level one, the first line says `P` and `Q` are logical statements and "
"the third line says\n"
"that `P` has a proof `p`.\n"
"\n"
"In the second line we have the implication `P → Q`, which we have called "
"`h`. We think of `h` \n"
"as a one-way road from the statement `P` to the statement `Q` in `Prop` "
"world. \n"
"In Maths, we would call `h` a function or a map. \n"
"\n"
"Finally, our goal is to prove `Q` is true.\n"
"\n"
"Using `exact h(p),` will prove our lemma.\n"
"\n"
"Why does this work? We know that `P` is true, since we have a proof of it "
"`p` and `h` tells us that\n"
"if `P` is true then `Q` is true. So combining `h` and `p` results in a proof "
"of `Q`.\n"
"\n"
"**Note: We use `h(p)` rather than `h(P)`, because we want to transform the "
"proof of `P` into \n"
"a proof of `Q`.**\n"

"\n"
"To help us with this, lets introduce some new tactics.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"## Tactics for Level 2\n"
"\n"
"## The `split` tactic\n"
"\n"
"If your goal is an \"and\" goal:\n"
"\n"
"```\n"
"⊢ P ∧ Q\n"
"```\n"
"\n"
"then the `split` tactic will turn it\n"
"into *two* goals\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"```\n"
"⊢ P\n"
"```\n"
"\n"
"and\n"
"\n"
"```\n"
"⊢ Q\n"
"```\n"
"\n"
"It is best practice to indicate when you are working with two goals, either "
"by using squiggly \n"
"brackets like this:\n"
"\n"
"```\n"
"...\n"
"split,\n"
"{ working on P,\n"
"  end of proof of P },\n"
"{ working on Q,\n"
"  end of proof of Q },\n"
"```\n"
"\n"
"or by using indentation like this:\n"
"\n"
"```\n"
"split,\n"
"  working on P,\n"
"  end of proof of P,\n"
"working on Q,\n"
"...\n"
"```\n"
"\n"
"Moreover, if you have an iff `↔` then splitting it will give you two goals, "
"`→` and `←` to prove.\n"
"\n"
"## `left` and `right`\n"
"\n"
"If your goal is\n"
"\n"
"```\n"
"⊢ P ∨ Q\n"
"```\n"
"\n"
"then `left` changes the goal to `⊢ P`. The logic is that `P` implies `P ∨ "
"Q`\n"
"so we can `apply` this implication. Similarly `right` changes the goal to `⊢ "
"Q`\n"
"\n"
"## The `cases` tactic\n"
"\n"
"`cases` is a very general-purpose tactic for \"deconstructing\" hypotheses.\n"
"If `h` is a hypothesis which somehow \"bundles up\" two pieces of "
"information,\n"
"then `cases h with h1 h2` will make hypothesis `h` vanish and will replace "
"it\n"
"with the two \"components\" which made the proof of `h` in the first place.\n"
"An example of this occurring in logic sheet 4 is `h : P ∧ Q` which is a\n"
"bundling of a proof of `P` and a proof of `Q`.\n"

"\n"
"Examples\n"
"--------\n"
"\n"
"1) If ``P`` is a proposition, then ``by_cases P`` turns your goal into two "

"\n"
"2) If you already have a hypothesis ``h`` then this can get a bit "
"confusing, \n"
"so you can also do ``by_cases hP : P``; then your new hypotheses will be "
